# Towel.app

**Towel.app** is aiming to be the only thing needed to carry around when you hitchhike&mdash; apart from your real towel, of course.

### Planned features

- browsing an offline snapshot of the [Hitchwiki maps](http://hitchwiki.org/maps/) database
- planning routes before you set off
- saving relevant map tiles for offline use
- setting location-based alerts to never again miss a drop-off place
- a copy of the [Hitchwiki knowledge base](http://hitchwiki.org/en/Main_Page)
- maybe a gratis babelfish too
